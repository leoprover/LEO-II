THE LEO-II System Installation Guide
(Christoph Benzmueller and Nik Sultana)


NOTES:
  * LEO-II runs under OCaml
  * It follows the TPTP ATP System Building Conventions
     ( http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/Proposals/SystemBuild.html )


LEO-II Installation Instructions:
 (1) Choose an [installation-directory], e.g. /home/chris/
 (2) Download latest LEO-II version from
         http://www.leoprover.org
     and store it in [installation-directory]
 (3) Change to the installation directory
                   cd [installation-directory]
 (4) Extract the files of the packages
                   tar xzf leo2-v***.tgz
 (5) Change to the main source directory of the LEO-II package
                   cd [installation-directory]/leo2/src

 (6) Run the configuration script -- running "./configure --help" will
     describe the options available.

 (7) Build a LEO-II executable -- there are different alternatives and
     each of them should work:
             - "make" will build an OCaml-bytecode version of LEO-II
             - "make opt" will build a native version of LEO-II
             - "make clean" removes generated binaries

     You can obtain a faster-performing binary by sacrificing
     helpful error messages. For this, use "make opt debug=false".

     To build LEO-II you need to have the ocamlfind utility.
     Furthermore, building MiniSAT (which is included in the
     distribution of LEO-II) requires GCC.

     Running these commands will create an executable
                  [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo

 (7) Try the following in case of errors during build
       - Run "make list_versions" and check if all the version numbers
         are identical.
       - Run "make cleaner", and then retry "make", to remove a binary
         used to speed-up building.
       - If you have multiple versions of OCaml in your PATH, you
         can specify which version to use via the --ocamlbindir parameter
         to the configure script.


Enabling the cooperation of LEO-II with at least one First-Order Prover:
- LEO-II is designed to cooperate with first-order provers. Thus installation
  of a first order prover is crucial in order to run LEO-II. While LEO-II
  can cooperate with different first-order provers, we recommend here to
  install the 'The E Equational Theorem Prover' which is available at
  http://www4.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/~schulz/WORK/eprover.html

- In the following we assume that the binary for running prover E is available
  in file
                   [eprover-directory]/eprover
- In order to inform LEO-II where it can find this binary for E you need to
  provide a file
                   [your-homedirectory]/.leoatprc
  containing the following entries:
                   e = [eprover-directory]/eprover
		   epclextract = [eprover-directory]/epclextract

Running LEO-II in Automatic Mode:
- To start LEO-II you need to type:
                  [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo
- Parameters are given in the following sequence:
                  [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo [OPTIONS] [FILE]
  In order to see which options can be set, run
                  [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo --help
- Usage examples:
   [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo [installation-directory]/leo2/distrib_examples/BrownSmolka-1.thf --proofoutput 1

   [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo -d [installation-directory]/leo2/distrib_examples -f e -t 40
   (please make sure that you have write permissions for [installation-directory]/leo2/distrib_examples)

   At CASC LEO-II is called as follows:
   [installation-directory]/leo2/bin/leo --timeout 30 --proofoutput 1 --foatp e \
     --atp e=[e-directory]/eprover '[problem-file-directory/SET014^4.tptp'


Running LEO-II in Interactive Mode is not currently recommended due to several open issues.
